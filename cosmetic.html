			<h2>Bonding</h2>
			<p>In some instances, the damage to your smile may not require a
				great deal of work. One of the easiest and least expensive ways to
				repair minor tooth problems such as chips, minor staining, and size
				or spacing issues is a process known as dental bonding. If your
				smile could use a little sprucing up, dental bonding in Ramanthapur,
				Hyderabad, may be right for you. To find out, call Ramanthapur
				Dental Clinic at +919963002821 to make an appointment to see our
				dentist, Dr. Srinivas N.C.H.</p>
			<p>Dental bonding is a simple, conservative way to improve the
				appearance of your smile. During the bonding process, our skilled
				dentist and team place a composite resin material directly onto the
				tooth structure. Because the resin is malleable and putty like when
				first applied, we can shape and sculpt it to fit your tooth and
				correct flaws in the tooth’s appearance. The composite resin is then
				hardened, trimmed and polished to provide a lasting, aesthetic
				restoration for your smile. Dental bonding typically requires just
				one visit to our welcoming dental office, and because this treatment
				usually necessitates little to no tooth preparation, you can rest
				assured that your visit will be quick and comfortable.</p>
			<p>Our dentist may recommend dental bonding in order to close
				gaps and spaces between teeth, improve misshapen teeth, lighten
				stained or discolored teeth, or restore chipped or cracked teeth. We
				will use a shade of composite resin that matches the original color
				of your teeth for a natural-looking effect. If you would prefer, we
				can use a slightly lighter shade to whiten the color of your teeth.</p>
			<p>For more information on cosmetic dental bonding and how we can
				help you improve your smile, we welcome you to contact us today.</p>
			<hr />

			<h2 id="Veneers">DENTAL VENEERS</h2>
			<p>If you are interested in an easy way to restore or enhance the
				appearance of your smile, talk to our dentist about dental veneers.
				These are placed over the front of a tooth to improve its
				appearance, size or shape, and they can last over ten years with the
				proper care. To make an appointment with Dr. Carter Reeves and his
				associates and to discover if dental veneers in Ashburn, Virginia,
				are right for you, call First Impression Dental at 571-465-2114 to
				plan your visit.</p>

			<p>Dental veneers are very thin shells, typically made of
				porcelain or resin, that are bonded to the front of your teeth to
				enhance the beauty of your smile. Our dentist may recommend dental
				veneers to correct several types of smile imperfections. Porcelain
				veneers are an excellent choice for enhancing your smile because the
				color and translucence of porcelain is a great match for the natural
				appearance of tooth enamel. Porcelain is stain resistant as well, so
				your smile will stay bright for years to come. Resin veneers can
				also be matched to your natural tooth color. With dental veneers,
				you can achieve a beautiful, natural-looking smile that you will
				love to show off.</p>
			<p>Our dentist may recommend dental veneers if you would like to
				improve the appearance of your smile. Custom-made veneers can be
				used for just one tooth or for your entire smile. We may suggest
				veneers to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Close large spaces and gaps between teeth</li>
				<li>Whiten teeth that are severely stained or discolored</li>
				<li>Improve the appearance of irregularly shaped teeth</li>
				<li>Correct slightly crooked teeth</li>
				<li>Restore teeth that are broken, chipped, worn or fractured</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We invite you to call or visit our office today to learn more
				about custom dental veneers and how we can enhance your smile. We
				look forward to hearing from you!</p>

			<h2 id="Recontouring">GUM RECONTOURING</h2>
			<p>An otherwise wonderful smile can lose a little of its appeal
				if you have too much gum tissue or uneven tissue. Fortunately, at
				First Impression Dental, this is very easy to repair with our gum
				recontouring treatment. In just one appointment with our dentist,
				Dr. Carter Reeves and his associates, you can have a picture-perfect
				smile. To find out how gum recontouring in Ashburn, Virginia, can
				transform your look, call 571-465-2114 today to schedule an
				appointment at First Impression Dental.</p>
			<p>Cosmetic gum surgery, which is also known as gingivectomy or
				crown lengthening, is a simple treatment we may recommend if your
				appearance is affected by what is sometimes called a “gummy smile.”
				A gummy smile is one in which the teeth appear abnormally short
				because of excessive gum tissue. The gum tissue may appear too
				bulky, or it might look like the gums come down over your teeth too
				far. In most cases, a gummy smile is the result of excessive gum
				tissue covering teeth that are a normal length and shape. To correct
				this problem and give you a smile you can show off with pride, our
				dentist may recommend cosmetic gum surgery. During this treatment,
				we will simply remove a small amount of the gum tissue, revealing
				more of the tooth structure and giving your smile a more aesthetic
				appearance. Cosmetic gum surgery usually requires just one visit to
				our office.</p>
			<p>If you have a gummy smile or your gum line appears uneven or
				asymmetrical, cosmetic gum surgery may be a good choice for
				improving your appearance. Our dentist will help you determine
				whether cosmetic gum surgery is right for your smile. Call us today
				to learn more and schedule your individual consultation!</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="Recontouring1">TOOTH RECONTOURING</h2>
			<p>You may only have one or two teeth that need a little extra
				attention. But your eyes go right to them every time you look in the
				mirror, and you are probably wondering if everyone else is looking
				at them, too. With a tooth recontouring appointment at First
				Impression Dental, our dentist can correct imperfections with one
				easy visit. If you have a smile that could use a little extra TLC,
				call 571-465-2114 today to schedule a consultation for tooth
				recontouring in Ashburn, Virginia, with Dr. Carter Reeves and his
				associates.</p>
			<p>Cosmetic contouring is a service designed to improve the shape
				of your teeth and enhance the overall appearance of your smile. In
				the cosmetic tooth contouring procedure, our dentist and team remove
				small amounts of tooth enamel, which is the protective outer layer
				of the tooth. By making careful changes to the shape of the enamel,
				we correct cosmetic dental flaws and give your smile a more
				attractive appearance. In certain cases, we may recommend combining
				cosmetic contouring with dental bonding to achieve optimal results.
				Our team is typically able to complete cosmetic contouring in just
				one visit to our office, so you can achieve a more beautiful smile
				after a single appointment!</p>
			<p>We may suggest cosmetic tooth contouring in order to make
				minor aesthetic changes to the size, length, surface or shape of
				your teeth. Tooth contouring can be used to correct:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Slight tooth overlapping</li>
				<li>Irregularly shaped teeth</li>
				<li>Teeth that appear too long or too large</li>
				<li>Dips, bumps or other imperfections on the tooth surface</li>
				<li>Chipped or cracked teeth</li>
				<li>Adjacent teeth of unequal length</li>
				<li>Teeth that look too pointed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tooth contouring is a great choice for patients who are
				interested in making subtle changes to their smile to achieve a more
				inviting aesthetic. If you think cosmetic contouring may be the
				solution you need to enhance your smile, we welcome you to call or
				visit our office today. We are eager to help you reach all of your
				goals for your smile!</p>

			<h2 id="SureSmile">INVISALIGN® AND SURESMILE®</h2>
			<p>Everyone wants a straighter smile, but not everyone wants to
				spend a year or more with a mouthful of metal that comes with
				traditional braces. And active teens and adults may not have the
				time to make multiple trips to the office for adjustments. And then
				of course, there are the food restrictions that make life with
				braces less than appealing. With clear orthodontic aligners, you can
				enjoy a straightened smile with less treatment time than braces,
				without the limits on your menu and without the metal. If you want
				to experience the difference of clear aligners in Ashburn, Virginia,
				call First Impression Dental at 571-465-2114 to plan your visit with
				our dentist, Dr. Carter Reeves and his associates.</p>
			<p>Our office is proud to provide two of the most popular clear
				aligner systems: Invisalign® and SureSmile®.</p>

			<h4>Invisalign</h4>

			<p>If you are looking for the most discreet orthodontic treatment
				you can get, ask us about Invisalign aligners! The Invisalign system
				uses a blend of plastic that is more comfortable than other aligners
				and is nearly invisible. Other clear aligners are difficult to
				notice; Invisalign is nearly impossible to spot!</p>

			<h4>SureSmile</h4>

			<p>If you are wanting a straighter smile in a smaller timeframe,
				meet with our dentist to learn more about SureSmile clear aligners.
				This clear aligner system uses some of the most advanced treatment
				planning software to create orthodontic plans that lead to lasting
				results faster. With SureSmile, you can trust that your new smile is
				being created with precision, comfort and speed.</p>
			<p>If you would like to learn more about orthodontic clear
				aligners and how you can begin your treatment, contact us today! We
				are excited to help you achieve your smile goals.</p>

			<hr />
			<h2 id="Whitening">KÖR® WHITENING</h2>
			<p>Maybe you have a big event coming up and you want your smile
				to look its best. Or maybe you just need to add a little extra
				something to your appearance with a brighter and whiter smile. Our
				dentist, Dr. Carter Reeves and his associates, offer KöR® Whitening
				in Ashburn, Virginia, to help your smile stand out! If you are ready
				for a smile that will get you noticed, call 571-465-2114 today to
				schedule a consultation at First Impression Dental.</p>
			<p>Teeth whitening is a simple, effective cosmetic dental
				treatment that we offer to noticeably enhance your smile in as
				little as one treatment. Our professional teeth whitening treatments
				utilize a powerful yet safe whitening gel that is applied to the
				surface of your teeth. This gel works to lighten the appearance of
				stains, discoloration and yellowing on the tooth enamel. Teeth
				whitening is often available in both in-office and take-home
				systems. Professional teeth whitening can give you a noticeably
				whiter smile that will boost your self-esteem and help you smile
				with pride.</p>
			<p>If you have ever wished that your smile were whiter and
				brighter, teeth whitening might be right for you. Through
				professional teeth whitening, we can lighten staining and
				discoloration caused by various factors, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The natural aging process</li>
				<li>Poor dental hygiene habits</li>
				<li>Consumption of certain drinks and foods, including tea,
					wine, coffee and soda</li>
				<li>Smoking and other forms of tobacco use</li>
				<li>Illness</li>
				<li>Certain medications</li>
				<li>Fluorosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our dentist will work with you to determine the right type of
				treatment and treatment length to achieve the smile aesthetic you
				desire. To learn more about professional teeth whitening and to set
				up your consultation at our office, please call us today.</p>
